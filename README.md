# ðŸ“§ Email Classification Using Logistic Regression,  TF-IDF & Flask

This project implements an **email classification system** using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Logistic Regression**. Additionally, a **Flask API** is provided to predict whether an email is **spam or ham**.
